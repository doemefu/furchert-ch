# Changelog — homelab-furchert-ch

All notable changes per milestone. Newest first.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Phase 2: Public pages ported pixel-faithfully from the prototype — Home,
  About, IT, Rowing, Projects (+ `/projects/[slug]` detail), Contact. Fully
  bilingual DE/EN via per-record locale-map typed `src/data/*` modules and
  next-intl `pages.*` labels. SEO: per-route `generateMetadata` with
  `alternates.languages`, `app/robots.ts` (disallows `/dashboard` +
  locale-prefixed variants), and `app/sitemap.ts` (next-intl
  `getPathname` + alternates). Contact form posts to a real server action
  (`'use server'`) that validates and server-logs — no silent fake success;
  real delivery wired in Phase 7. One CSS hover rule replaces a would-be
  client component; only `ContactForm` is `'use client'`. `Btn` gained
  additive `type`/`disabled` props for real form submission.
- Phase 1: Next.js (App Router, TS) skeleton + ETHON design system — pinned deps
  (Next 14.2.23/React 18.3.1/next-intl 3.26.4), DM Sans/Mono fonts, design
  tokens (`globals.css`), UI primitives, layout chrome (Header/Footer/Ticker),
  DE/EN i18n routing (`/`→`/de`), typed prototype data. Builds + lints clean.
  Tweaks panel intentionally excluded (design-tool artifact, not a product feature).
- Phase 0: Claude Code working conventions — `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/` (8),
  `.claude/agents/` (7), `.claude/skills/start-task`, worklog template, memory
  seed, settings; top-level documentation stubs (OVERVIEW, INTERFACES, DEPLOYMENT,
  CONTRIBUTING, this file, `docs/INDEX.md`). No application code yet.
